MAPT (Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau)

Clinical Relevance: Mutations in the MAPT gene are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.
Function: This gene encodes the tau protein, which stabilizes microtubules in neurons. Abnormal tau protein aggregation is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases.
NPTX1 (Neuronal Pentraxin 1)

Clinical Relevance: NPTX1 has been implicated in neurological disorders and is thought to play a role in synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopmental processes.
Function: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in synaptic plasticity, helping to regulate synapse formation and maintenance.
ANK1 (Ankyrin 1)

Clinical Relevance: Mutations in ANK1 are associated with hereditary spherocytosis, a condition that affects red blood cells and can cause anemia.
Function: Ankyrin proteins link integral membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton, maintaining cell shape and stability, particularly in red blood cells.
MEN1 (Menin 1)

Clinical Relevance: Mutations in MEN1 cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), a disorder characterized by tumors in endocrine glands.
Function: MEN1 encodes the protein menin, a tumor suppressor involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and cell proliferation control.
BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1)

Clinical Relevance: BRCA1 mutations significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. It is a critical gene in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes.
Function: BRCA1 is involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, and maintaining genomic stability. It acts as a tumor suppressor gene.
GALNT2 (Polypeptide N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2)

Clinical Relevance: Variations in GALNT2 have been linked to lipid metabolism disorders and cardiovascular diseases.
Function: GALNT2 is involved in the O-glycosylation of proteins, which is crucial for protein function, stability, and cell signaling.
